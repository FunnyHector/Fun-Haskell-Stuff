-- | Create a graph with given lists of vertices and edges. Will raise an error
--   if any edge has a start or end vertex which is not in the given list of
--   vertices, or if there are repeated vertices or edges.
makeGraph :: ([a], [(a,b,a)]) -> Graph a b





-- | Return the set of predecessors of a vertex (in a given graph â€“ this will be
--   left implicit in describing subsequent functions), i.e. the set of all vertices
--   u, such that there is an edge from u to the given vertex.
predecessors :: Graph a b -> a -> Set a





-- | Return the set of successors of a vertex, i.e. the set of all vertices v,
--   such that there is an edge from the given vertex to v.
successors :: Graph a b -> a -> Set a





-- | Check whether a graph is connected, relative to a given start vertex, i.e.
--   if there is a directed path from a given vertex to every other vertex.
isConnected :: Graph a b -> a -> Bool





-- | Find a path from one given vertex to another, if there is one. If there is
--   more than one path from u to v, then findPath g u v (may return any one of them.)
--   TODO: update the description in brackets to make it definitive
findPath :: Graph a b -> a -> a -> Maybe Path a b





-- | Find the label on a path from one given vertex to another, if there is one.
--   The label on a path is the list of labels on the edges in the path. If there
--   is more than one path from u to v, then findPathLabel g u v (may return the label on any one of them.)
--   TODO: update the description in brackets to make it definitive
findPathLabel :: Graph a b -> a -> a -> Maybe [b]





-- | Find a path with minimal cost from one given vertex to another, if there is
--   one. If there is more than one path from u to v, with minimal cost then
--   findMinCostPath g u v (may return any one of them.)
--   TODO: update the description in brackets to make it definitive
findMinCostPath :: Graph a b -> a -> a -> Maybe Path a b





-- | Find a path starting from a given vertex with a given label. If there is
--   more than one path starting from u with label s, then findPathWithLabel g u s
--   (may return any one of them.)
--   TODO: update the description in brackets to make it definitive
findPathWithLabel :: Graph a b -> a -> [b] -> Maybe Path a b

-- | Construct a minimal cost spanning tree for a given graph, where Tree a b is
--   a type consisting of trees with vertices of type a and labels of type b on
--   its edges.
--   TODO: This function is using (Prim's / Kruskal's) algorithm
